** INPROGRESS Finish prototype of Photoshop Filters plugin :work:plugin:monarch:
   DEADLINE: <2009-05-29 Fri>
*** INPROGRESS Plug-in integration
    This is almost done, just need to add some more basic boilerplate code.
*** TODO Make a superficial UI
    OK, Cancel, image display, and dynamically populated pane that
    takes a bunch of scroll bars and buttons, basically, whatever is
    needed for the transformation
*** TODO Image resizing to miniature
    Image needs to be resized to about 1.5 megapixel image - this image
    will be the one that all operations will be done on
*** TODO Rendering the miniature inside Photoshop
    The miniature should be rendered using some internal Photoshop API
    that is used to draw graphics inside of a dialogue
*** TODO Image transformation
    Image transformations will simply be the functions that are provided
    by kwelib
*** TODO Converting BEF back to sRGB
    Use kwe::cmss::colorspace class in order to do these transforms
*** TODO Rendering sRGB
    This is already addressed by image transformation
*** TODO User interface event code
    This will be somewhat copied from UCT Studio's dialogue event code,
    however, I'm going to see if it'll be possible to use a platform-
    indepedent library like Qt here, so that the code can be written just
    once for both Mac and PC. ADM Dialogs code is also an
    option.
